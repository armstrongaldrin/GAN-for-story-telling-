Story Generator
Overview
The Story Generator is a Python application that utilizes the GPT-2 language model to generate creative stories based on a given prompt. The application is built using tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the transformers library from Hugging Face to interact with the GPT-2 model.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive GUI built with tkinter where users can enter a prompt and generate stories.
Multiple Story Generation: Generates multiple stories (up to 3) based on a single prompt.
Customizable Story Length: The maximum length of the generated stories can be adjusted in the code.
Requirements
To run the Story Generator, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x
The following Python libraries:
tkinter (for the GUI)
transformers (for interacting with GPT-2)
torch (required by the transformers library for model inference)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install transformers torch
tkinter is usually included with Python, but if you don't have it, you can install it based on your operating system.

Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python libraries as listed in the Requirements section.

Run the application using the following command:
python story_generator.py
Enter a prompt in the input field of the GUI and click the "Generate Story" button.

Read the generated stories in the text box that appears below.

Code Structure
generate_and_display_story: This function retrieves the user's prompt, generates stories using GPT-2, and displays the results in the GUI.
generate_story: This function interacts with the GPT-2 model to generate stories based on the provided prompt.
GUI Elements:
Prompt Input: An entry widget where users can type their prompt.
Generate Button: A button to trigger the story generation process.
Story Display: A text widget to display the generated stories.
Customization
Change Model: The model used is GPT-2 (gpt2). You can switch to a different model (e.g., gpt2-medium, gpt2-large) by changing the model_name variable in the generate_story function.
Adjust Story Length: Modify the max_length parameter in the generate_story function to change the length of the generated stories.
Number of Stories: The num_return_sequences parameter in the generate_story function determines how many stories are generated from the same prompt.
Example
Enter a prompt like "Once upon a time in a distant land," and click "Generate Story." The application will display three different stories generated by GPT-2.
